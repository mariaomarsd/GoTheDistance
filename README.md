## Project Description 

A website that keeps track of all your travels. You can see a visual representation of all your travels (displayed as lined on the map), view individual trips in more detail and see statistics about your travels. To add a new trip you can either search for the places you want to add to the trip. When you have added all the places that you visited you can create the trip and it is added to your list of trips.
